The Bramley Village Society normally holds an annual dinner to celebrate our patron saint; usually in the evening of St. George's Day itself.  This year we decided not to hold the St. George's Day Dinner as we were not sure that sufficient numbers coud be ensured.  However, we do hope to hold the event next year, on Sunday the 23rd of April.
All are very welcome to come and enjoy a great three course meal with traditional roast and dessert.  If you would like to be part of an 'English' tradition, please contact Joe O'Connell on 894250, come to the [Bramley Showcase] (next Showcase will be March/April 2023), or email [BVS](mailto:BramleyVillageSociety@gmail.com).

Please note that tickets must be bought in advance and places are limited.
