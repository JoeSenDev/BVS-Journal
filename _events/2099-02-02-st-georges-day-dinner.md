**St. George's Day Dinner in the Jolly Farmer - Timing and Price to be finalised**

Every year the Bramley Village Society holds an annual dinner to celebrate our patron saint; normally in the evening of St. George's Day itself.  All are very welcome to come and enjoy a great three course meal with traditional roast and dessert.  If you would like to be part of an 'English' tradition, please contact Joe O'Connell on 894250, come to the Bramley Showcase (_posts/2022-02-03-2022-Showcase.md), or email [BVS](mailto:BramleyVillageSociety@gmail.com).

Please note that tickets must be bought in advance and places are limited.
