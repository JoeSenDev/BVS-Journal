**Our next Showcase will be in March next year.**

The local clubs, societies and voluntary organisations are an important part of what makes Bramley such a vibrant community. Not only do they provide recreational and social facilities, they also enable residents to meet with like-minded others.

The Bramley Showcase is an annual event run by the Bramley Village Society where the clubs, societies and organisations set out their wares in the Village Hall. To help the evening along, we provide a free glass of wine, Bramley cider, or a soft drink on your arrival.

Everyone is encouraged to drop in, so why not come and socialise with other residents. The Village Society is particularly keen to ensure new residents find out what is available in Bramley, so if you have new neighbours who may not have signed up to the Bramley Update, please encourage them to attend the Bramley Showcase - it's a fun evening, and an easy way to get integrated into village life.

If your local club, society, or voluntary organisation hasn't attended a Showcase evening before and would like to this year, [please contact the Village Society]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contact.md %}).
